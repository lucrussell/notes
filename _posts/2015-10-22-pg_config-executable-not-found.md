psycopg complains about missing pg_config executable.

If you don't already have pg_config installed and on your path, do this first:

     brew install postgresql 
    

Then install psycopg2 on command line:

    source venv/bin/activate
    (venv)$ pip install psycopg2
    ...Successfully installed psycopg2-2.6.1
