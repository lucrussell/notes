## Docker Compose Force Rebuild
Also see [here][18].

    docker-compose rm -v -f
    docker-compose build --no-cache
    docker-compose up --force-recreate

For compose files where you have trouble removing referenced images, try:

    docker-compose down --rmi all

See [Docker Compose reference](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/down/).

## Working With Docker for Mac

### Aliasing 0.0.0.0 to work around dynamic IPs

To solve this problem: 
    > I want to connect from a container to a service on the host. The 
    > mac has a changing IP address or no address if you have no network access 

The current recommendation is to attach an unused IP to the lo0 interface on the Mac e.g. 
    
    sudo ifconfig lo0 alias 10.200.10.1/24

Make sure your service is listening on this address or 0.0.0.0 
(i.e. not 127.0.0.1). Then any containers which need to access the 
service can use the `10.200.10.1` address.



### Accessing The Xyve Virtual Machine

You might need to do this after restarting/upgrading docker. To get into the xyve vm use `screen`:

    screen ~/Library/Containers/com.docker.docker/Data/com.docker.driver.amd64-linux/tty 
    
The login is 'root', no password.

### Add an Internal Company Registry or Repo

    vi /etc/hosts 

and add the address e.g.:

    10.10.10.100   my-registry.mycompany.com

Exit screen with `Ctrl-a` then `k`.

Here is a `screen` reference: http://ss64.com/osx/screen.html.

## Get Into a Docker Container without docker-enter

    docker exec -it 963ffd75c1b5 /bin/bash

## Get Into a Docker Image which Fails to Start

    docker run -it applications_mycontainer /bin/bash 

Use `docker images` to find the correct image name

## Free up Disk Space Used by Docker

See [this reference](http://blog.yohanliyanage.com/2015/05/docker-clean-up-after-yourself/).

For issues related to the size of the Docker.qcow2 file, see [this link](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/371).


## Temporarily Install a Package for Troubleshooting

If you need to, you can probably simply install packages in any transient container, e.g.:

    apt-get update
    apt-get install netcat
    nc -v -w3 10.10.10.100 5432

## Run A Container With Env Variables for Testing

    docker run -it -e  MY_ENV_VAR=somevalue myrepo/myapp:latest /bin/bash

## Remove Containers Created and Exited 2 Weeks ago

    docker ps -a | grep "2 weeks" | grep "Exited" | awk '{print $1}' | sudo xargs docker rm

## Remove All Exited Containers

    docker ps -a | grep Exit | awk '{print $1}' |  xargs docker rm

## Grep Docker stdout and stderr
E.g. if you have an application that's writing to both streams and you're not sure where logs are going:

    docker logs 4017b8a68f98 2>&1 | grep

## Keep a Container Running
E.g. if it starts and immediately exits:

    sudo docker run -t -i my-registry/mycontainer /bin/bash

This will attach you directly to the container so you can check the logs.

    sudo docker run -d my-registry/my-container /bin/bash

This will start it detached.

## Run A Container With a Link to Another

    docker run --rm -t -i --name mycontainer --link docker_consul_1 my-registry/mycontainer

## Logs
Get the last 20 lines of logs:

    docker logs --tail 20 fc805ce579d3
