pg_config Executable Not Found
==============================
psycopg complains about missing pg_config executable. 

If you don't already have pg_config installed and on your path, do this
first:
 
     brew install postgresql 

Then install psycopg2 on command line:

```
source venv/bin/activate
(venv)$ pip install psycopg2
...Successfully installed psycopg2-2.6.1
```
